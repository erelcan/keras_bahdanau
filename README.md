# Keras Bahdanau Attention

This project implements **[Bahdanau Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf)** mechanism through creating **custom Keras GRU** cells.

# Goals
- Have a Keras compatible Bahdanau Attention mechanism.
    - Simple and comprehensible implementation.
    - Re-usable and intuitive Bahdanau Decoder.
- Produce a guiding documentation for comprehending:
    - Implementations of Keras recurrent cells.
    - Custom Keras cell implementation.
    - Intuition behind the proposed Bahdanau Mechanims implementation.
